Hi there 👋

I’m Marcel — a physicist transitioning into Data Science.
My background is in experimental quantum optics, where I worked on semiconductor quantum dots, Franson interferometry, and coherence phenomena. I’m now expanding my skill set toward data analysis, SQL, Python, and applied machine learning.

🔭 Currently working on

My PhD thesis on energy–time entanglement in the dressed XX–X cascade

Data analysis workflows in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

SQL-based marketplace and logistics analytics (WBS Coding School project)

🌱 Currently learning

Data Science (part-time program, WBS Coding School)

Applied statistics and probabilistic modelling

Visualization and dashboarding (Tableau, Power BI)

💡 Interests

Quantum technologies, photonics, and coherent light–matter interaction

Data-driven decision making, analytics for e-commerce and tech

Clean, reproducible research and transparent workflows
